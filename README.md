kipettools : Tools for the KI PET Group
=======================================

The kipettools package is a set of tools developed over the past few years to help with regular tasks at the KI PET Centre involving interacting with outputs from the pipeline using R. This package basically consists of convenience functions developed over the years which have been useful, but due to this process, much of the code is not very pretty, coming from early stages of learning R, or from hacking something together for the job at hand. Nevertheless, these tools have stood the test of time in being useful, so hopefully having them all documented and saved in one place will make them more so..
